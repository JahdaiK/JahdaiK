## About Me
I am a Front-End Developer who values functionality and aesthetics. Prior to becoming a software engineer, I led a dual life as a SAAS customer champion and an artist. My extensive background in SAAS customer-facing roles has provided me the ability to understand users' needs and effectively advocate for them to product, sales, C-suite stakeholders. My artistic background not only fuels my creativity but also allows me to approach challenges with innovative and out-of-the-box solutions. My background allows me to enhance the users' experience both technically and visually. It is my goal to work with businesses and creatives to build websites and platforms that truly represent their brand both aesthetically and technically.
